## Overview

This project aims to develop a web application for [Spire](https://www.spirehawaii.com/), a Hawaii-based CPA firm, as part of our ICS 414 Software Engineering class. This application will transition Spireâ€™s Fiscal Sustainability Model (FSM) from a complex Excel-based tool to an intuitive, web-based platform, streamlining access and enhancing functionality for financial forecasting.
